# 180-Day Right-Sizing Demo Data Pipeline — Process & Review Findings

> **Status:** operational doc for the `demo-data/` scripts, committed with them. The
> scripts store no credentials: they read the object-store secret from the cluster at
> run time and refuse to run unless `EXPECTED_SERVER_SUBSTR` matches the logged-in hub.
>
> **Update 2026-09-25:** the profile now has realistic filler (`NUM_POD_METRICS=20
> NUM_CLUSTER_METRICS=154` → 134,572 series/block for N=100/W=10/P=3) and unique pod
> names; preflight/upload size capacity for the downsampled copies too. Numbers in
> §3/§4 marked "without filler" predate this; see the notes under each section.
>
> **Update 2026-09-28:** the hub's object store is S3, not in-cluster MinIO.
> `generate_and_publish.sh` replaces the generate-everything-then-upload flow (§1, §4,
> §5): one cluster-week at a time, uploaded while the next generates, ~3 GB of local
> disk, resumable. `configure_hub_s3.sh` points the hub at its S3 prefix; the
> validators read the object store from the hub's Secret. The MinIO-only scripts
> (`upload_180day_batched.sh`, `expand_minio_pvc.sh`) are legacy. See `README.md`.
>
> **Scope:** generate synthetic ACM right-sizing data (trial or full 180-day), load
> it into a shared ACM MultiClusterObservability (MCO) hub's Thanos/MinIO backstore,
> and validate that Thanos compaction + downsampling behave correctly.
>
> **Validated 2026-09-24:** 20-cluster × 2-week trial (N=100/W=10/P=3, 360 blocks,
> 74,418 series/block) on jdj64. Compaction confirmed: levels 4–7, raw+5m+1h tiers,
> largest block 331.7h, no overlaps, all 20 clusters OK.
>
> **Shared S3 distribution plan:** see `SHARED_S3_PLAN.md` (v3, reviewed × 2 rounds)

## 1. What this pipeline does

`thanosbench` generates synthetic Prometheus/Thanos TSDB blocks from a named
profile. For the leveled right-sizing model we use `custom-continous-1-week-full`
(cluster → namespace → workload → pod, with a `profile` label = Max OverAll / P95 /
P99, byte-scale memory, and `recommendation = usage × 1.10`).

The end-to-end flow is **four stages** — note that generation writes to **local
disk**, and a separate step uploads to object storage. You do not "generate into
S3" directly.

```

```

**Key architectural fact:** on the target hub the object store is **already wired
to Thanos** (the `thanos-object-storage` secret, set up by ACM MCO, points Thanos
at the in-cluster MinIO `thanos` bucket). Wiring Thanos → bucket is a **one-time**
setup; this pipeline does **not** reconfigure Thanos — it only puts blocks into the
existing bucket and lets the store-gateway sync them. (Configuring the bucket is
only needed when standing up / normalizing a fresh Thanos — e.g. the earlier
`reconfigure_thanos_minio.sh` on a different hub.)

---

## 2. How Thanos treats the data (the mental model)

Three **independent** mechanisms act on blocks; the "180 days / 2 weeks" intuition
maps to compaction + downsampling + retention differently:

| Mechanism | What it does | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| **Compaction** | merges adjacent blocks into larger ones | block **time-span**, per external-label set; halts on overlap |
| **Downsampling** | adds lower-resolution **copies** (5m, then 1h) | block span ≥ **40h** → 5m; ≥ **10d** → 1h |
| **Retention** | **deletes** blocks per resolution | block **maxTime** older than `retention.resolution-{raw,5m,1h}` |

For a settled 180-day dataset per cluster you end up with the **full tier pyramid**:
raw + 5m + 1h, each covering the whole range, blocks merged up to the compactor's
max window (~2 weeks; configurable). Downsampling is **additive** (raw is retained).

Correctness properties we rely on (all confirmed by the Thanos-expert review):
- Compaction groups strictly by **external-label set** → each demo cluster compacts
  independently, never mixing with real data. Deletion by `cluster` label is therefore safe.
- Downsampling resolution values in `meta.json` (`thanos.downsample.resolution`, ms):
  **`0` raw / `300000` 5m / `3600000` 1h**.
- `recommendation = usage × 1.10` **survives downsampling** — constant scaling commutes
  with the min/max/sum/count aggregates, so the ratio holds at every tier.
- Our raw cadence is **15 min** (filler: 5 min), no finer than the 5m bucket, so 5m
  downsampling doesn't reduce the point count at all, and every point is stored as 5
  aggregates (count/sum/min/max/counter). The 5m copy is therefore **~3.8× larger** than
  raw (measured with Thanos v0.42.4: a 248 MB 48h block became 945 MB), and the 1h copy
  is about the raw size (~0.85–1.1×). Downsampling only saves space for data scraped
  faster than every 5 min; here the hub ends up holding **~5.9× the upload**.

### Two corrections to earlier assumptions (important)
1. **Consistency-delay keys off ULID mint time, not data age.** The compactor's
   `--consistency-delay` (default **30m**) ignores any block whose *ULID* is younger
   than 30m. Our ULIDs are minted at generation time = *now*, so **every** freshly
   uploaded block waits ~30m before the compactor touches it — regardless of how old
   its data timestamps are. Compaction/downsampling therefore begin **~30m after
   upload**, not ~5m. (Store-gateway does **not** apply this delay → raw data is still
   queryable within minutes.)
2. **Retention below 180d silently discards the run.** Retention deletes by
   **`maxTime`**. Because we backfill blocks with data timestamps up to ~180d old, if
   any tier's MCO retention is below ~182d the compactor deletion-marks and removes
   most blocks **within hours** of upload — the entire 78 GB run is wasted. This is the
   #1 pre-check, not a footnote.

---

## 3. Configs & measured economics

Measured on the validated 3-day run (small config): avg **7.24 MB/block**, index ≈
50% of each block (**cardinality-heavy, sample-sparse**), ~**9.9 bytes/sample**,
~**1.46M samples/sec** generation throughput.

Series/block = `3 profiles × (6 measures × (1 + N + N·W + N·W·P) + 2N)`.

| Config | N / W / P | series/block | total (702 blocks) | volume |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Small** (validated) | 20 / 5 / 10 | 20,298 | 3 clusters × 234 | ~10 GB |
| **Full** (default driver) | 40 / 10 / 20 | 152,178 | 3 clusters × 234 | ~79 GB |

The table is **without filler**. With the recommended filler (`NUM_POD_METRICS=20
NUM_CLUSTER_METRICS=154`, N=100/W=10/P=3) a block has 134,572 series and one cluster-week
measured ~0.92 GB, so 20 clusters × 26 weeks is ~0.5 TB to upload and ~3 TB on the hub
after downsampling.

Both produce **702 blocks** (9 blocks/week × 26 weeks × 3 clusters) over 182 days —
block *count* is time-driven, not cardinality-driven. `custom-continous-1-week-full`
spans exactly **168h**, so stepping `--max-time` by 7 days tiles cleanly (only ~15-min
seam gaps from the first-sample shave; gaps are fine, overlaps would halt the compactor).

---

## 4. Timing expectations

Extrapolated from measured throughput; the two big unknowns are **port-forward
throughput** (~10–40 MB/s) and the **shared compactor's** speed.

| Phase | Trial (20 clusters × 2w, N=100/W=10/P=3) | Full (20 clusters × 26w) | Bottleneck |
|---|---|---|---|
| Generate (local) | **~17 min measured** (995s for 360 blks) | ~3.5 h (×13) | CPU / index build; ~9 GB RAM peak |
| Upload → MinIO (port-forward) | **~2.5h measured** (360 blocks with 60s stage pause) | ~30h (×13 blocks + pauses) | port-forward ~10-40 MB/s; use `STAGE_PAUSE_SEC=60` |
| Raw queryable (store-gw sync) | ~2–5 min | ~5–15 min | index-header load |
| Compaction + 5m + 1h settle | **~1h measured** (all 20 clusters, all tiers) | ~2–6 h | single compactor, 3× rewrite |

The rows above are **without filler**. With the recommended filler, generation measured
~90 s per cluster-week (~13 h for 20 clusters × 26 weeks, ~8.2 GB RAM peak), and the
compactor has ~89B samples to downsample for the full run (estimated 5–8 h at the
3–5M samples/s measured locally).

**Measured on jdj64 (2026-09-24):** 20-cluster trial, 74,418 series/block, ~44 MB/block.
Compaction completed aggressively: 452/568 blocks deletion-marked within ~1h of upload,
all clusters reached levels 4–7, 331.7h largest span, raw+5m+1h confirmed.

**When can you consume?** Raw data: ~5–15 min after store-gw resync (you do *not*
wait for the compactor). Fast 180-day dashboards (served from the 1h tier): after the
compactor settles. Compaction itself starts ~30 min post-upload (consistency-delay).

---

## 5. The scripts

All are operator-run ops scripts. Credentials are always read in-place from
the `thanos-object-storage` secret and **never printed**. A **run-manifest**
(`gen-180day.manifest.json`) written by the generator is the single source of truth
(base epoch, weeks, clusters, cardinality, expected counts) that the later stages read.

| Script | Role | Key env vars |
|---|---|---|
| `generate_180day.sh` | blocks → local disk + manifest | `NUM_NAMESPACES/WORKLOADS/PODS`, `WEEKS`, `FORCE`, `DRY_RUN`, `OUT` |
| `preflight_180day.sh` | READ-ONLY go/no-go gates | `MIN_RETENTION_DAYS` (182), `CAP_MARGIN` |
| `expand_minio_pvc.sh` | replace emptyDir → 500Gi PVC on MinIO | `PVC_SIZE` (500Gi), `EXPECTED_SERVER_SUBSTR` |
| `upload_180day_batched.sh` | local blocks → MinIO + resync | `RESUME`, `TEARDOWN`, `RESTART_STORE` (rolling\|all\|none), `STAGE_PAUSE_SEC`, `PARALLEL`, `SKIP_CAPACITY_CHECK` |
| `validate_compaction_180day.sh` | compaction/downsampling in MinIO | `REQUIRE_SETTLED`, `GAP_THRESH_H`, `MANIFEST` |
| `validate_load.sh` | query-side correctness (full range) | `DAYS` (182/14), `STEP`, `SVC`, `MANIFEST` |

**Known script gotchas fixed 2026-09-24:**
- Bash `eval "$(python3 - "${MANIFEST}" <<'PY'...)"` is broken when the Python contains
  `"` inside f-string `{...}` — bash mis-parses the heredoc and leaks Python source into
  the eval'd string. Fix: write Python output to `$(mktemp)` then `source` it. All scripts
  now use this pattern.
- `validate_load.sh` defaults to `observability-thanos-query-frontend` (port 9090) and a
  300s timeout. At 20-cluster scale, pod-level queries (180k series) time out against the
  raw query service in 60s. Use the query-frontend which has per-query caching.
- If MinIO is running with an emptyDir volume (common on fresh MCO deployments), run
  `expand_minio_pvc.sh` once to replace it with a 500Gi PVC before uploading large datasets.

### Runbook

```bash
# 1. GENERATE (full config). Refuses a non-empty OUT (use FORCE=1 to wipe & regen).
DRY_RUN=1 NUM_NAMESPACES=40 NUM_WORKLOADS=10 NUM_PODS=20 bash generate_180day.sh   # preview
NUM_NAMESPACES=40 NUM_WORKLOADS=10 NUM_PODS=20 bash generate_180day.sh

# 2. PREFLIGHT — must print "GO" before uploading (read-only; no changes).
!  bash preflight_180day.sh

# 3. UPLOAD. Resume a dropped run with RESUME=1; tear down later with TEARDOWN=1.
!  bash upload_180day_batched.sh
!  RESUME=1 bash upload_180day_batched.sh        # after any port-forward drop

# 4. VALIDATE (poll compaction over hours; then query-side).
!  bash validate_compaction_180day.sh            # re-run to watch tiers appear
!  REQUIRE_SETTLED=1 bash validate_compaction_180day.sh   # once you expect it done
   bash validate_load.sh                         # full-range query assertions

# Teardown (label-scoped delete of demo data only):
!  TEARDOWN=1 bash upload_180day_batched.sh
```

Exit codes: validators return **0 = pass, 1 = data problem, 2 = environment/not-ready**
(so they can gate scripts and CI, and "not ready yet" is distinct from "data wrong").

## 6. Multi-perspective review — findings & resolutions

Four independent reviews (Architecture, Platform/PE, QE, Thanos-internals) were run
before execution. Cross-reviewer agreement raised confidence. Below: the consolidated,
deduped findings and how each is now handled in the hardened scripts.

### 🔴 Data-correctness (apply regardless of cluster tenancy)
| # | Finding | Reviewers | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | MCO retention < 182d silently deletes the run by `maxTime` | Thanos, PE | `preflight` check #2 parses `retentionConfig`, requires all tiers ≥182d, NO-GO otherwise |
| 2 | Validators never failed (always exit 0) → false green | QE, PE | both validators now assert and return real exit codes (0/1/2) |
| 3 | `validate_load.sh` checked only last 3 of 182 days | Arch, PE, QE, Thanos | full-range query window from manifest + coverage checks at oldest **and** newest ts + `max_source_resolution=1h` probe |
| 4 | Generation non-idempotent; re-run appends a mis-tiled batch → overlap → halt | Arch, QE, PE | refuses non-empty `OUT` unless `FORCE=1`; `BASE_EPOCH` pinned & floored to a UTC day; per-week + total block-count asserts |
| 5 | Silent `meta.json` undercount faked "no overlaps" / left demo blocks undeleted | QE | delete-scan and validator reconcile listed-vs-fetched metas, retry, and **abort** if incomplete |
| 6 | Overlap check false-positive (level-1 sources vs level-2 parent) **and** false-negative (adjacency-only) | Arch, Thanos, QE | overlap checked per `(cluster, resolution, level)` with a running-max sweep; deletion-marked blocks excluded |
| 7 | 1.10 ratio & verdicts printed, not asserted; global-OR hid a broken cluster | QE | assert ratio min **and** max ∈ [1.0999, 1.1001] with expected series count; per-cluster AND-reduced verdict |

### 🟠 Operational safety (blockers on a shared cluster)
| # | Finding | Reviewers | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | No MinIO capacity precheck before ~79 GB to a shared bucket → ENOSPC on real ingestion | PE | `preflight` check #3 + inline guard in `upload` (free ≥ size × margin; `SKIP_CAPACITY_CHECK` override) |
| 9 | `sync`/`cp` doesn't upload `meta.json` last → store-gw reads partial blocks mid-run | PE, Thanos | per-block **two-phase**: data first (`--exclude meta.json`), then `meta.json` last |
| 10 | All store shards restarted at once → full query outage; OOM risk from 702 large blocks | Arch, PE, Thanos | **rolling** restart (one shard, wait Ready) by default; `RESTART_STORE=none` to rely on auto-sync; preflight prints shard mem headroom |

### 🟡 Minors — all addressed
Temp `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` (no global `~/.aws` mutation) · random local port + `mktemp`
temp files (no collisions) · empty `EXPECTED_SERVER_SUBSTR` rejected · local `df`
precheck before ~79 GB gen · gap detection (a missing week can't hide behind "182d")
· deletion-marked blocks excluded from counts/coverage · decorrelated gauge jitter ·
`request_hard`, pod-level byte-scale, and profile/workload_type balance now asserted ·
staged-by-cluster upload with progress + optional `STAGE_PAUSE_SEC` · `TEARDOWN` mode ·
compactor scratch-PVC and downsampling-enabled checks in preflight · stale header
comments fixed.

### ✅ Confirmed correct (unchanged)
Per-external-label compaction grouping and delete-by-`cluster`-label safety · halt-on-overlap
(no vertical compaction by default) · downsampling thresholds 40h→5m, 10d→1h ·
resolution ms values 0/300000/3600000 and the `thanos.downsample.resolution` path ·
the 1.10 invariant surviving downsampling · additive downsampling · store-gw queryable
in minutes · 168h weekly tiling avoids overlaps · no replica/dedup needed · 5M series/block cap.

## 7. Safety model & standing constraints

- **Hub is treated as read-only** except for the deliberate demo-data mutations, which
  are delivered as **user-run** scripts (never executed by the assistant).
- **Credentials never printed** — read in-place from the secret; the permission
  classifier blocks direct reads of `thanos-object-storage`.
- **Blast radius contained** — the pipeline only ever deletes blocks whose external
  `cluster` label is one of the demo clusters in the run-manifest (`ac-test-man-*`),
  never real tenant data, and aborts if it cannot prove the demo set is clean.
- **No secrets in git** — the scripts and this doc are committed, but no credentials,
  kubeconfigs, generated blocks or run-manifests are (see `.gitignore`).

---

## 8. Known limitations / open items

- **Compactor churn is unpredictable** at full config (single `observability-thanos-compact-0`,
  hours). `validate_compaction_180day.sh` is re-runnable to poll; use `REQUIRE_SETTLED=1`
  only once you expect it done.
- **Port-forward at 79 GB** is the slow, drop-prone link. Resumable (`RESUME=1`), but the
  faster long-term path is an **in-cluster Job** (generate + push over the cluster network),
  which is designed but not yet built (needs a thanosbench image).
- **Data ages out** — timestamps are pinned to wall-clock at generation. The oldest week
  ends ~175 days before generation, so with MCO's default 365d retention it is deleted
  ~190 days after generation (only ~7 days at the 182d minimum). Regenerate to refresh.
- **No pod churn** — the same pods exist for all 180 days (real pods get new names on
  every rollout), so long-range pod-level queries come out somewhat optimistic.
- **Filler is thinner than real metrics** — it matches the series count and the
  pod/namespace fan-out, but real series carry more labels (uid, node, image, …).
- **`workload_type` casing** (PascalCase) still pending confirmation against the ACM
  dashboard's expected values (tracked as an open PR question, unrelated to this pipeline).
